## About Me

I am a PhD student at the Molecular AI department in AstraZeneca as well as at Chalmers University. Previously I studied computer science at Imperial College where I developed an interest in deep learning and symbolic AI. I mostly work on deep learning for molecular generation and representation learning, although I have also previously worked on neurosymbolic learning, reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms.
